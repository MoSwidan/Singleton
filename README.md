# Singleton Design Pattern in Dart

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton Design Pattern in Dart.

## How to Use

1. The `Database` class ensures that only one instance of the class is created.
2. The `Client` class tests the Singleton pattern by creating two instances and checking if they are the same.
